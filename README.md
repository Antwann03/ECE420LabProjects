# ECE 420 - Digital Logic and FPGA Design Lab

## Student: Antonio Anzora Jr  


This repository contains all labs for ECE 420 and ECE 420 Projects. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress in digital logic design, FPGA programming, and verification using VHDL/Verilog.

## Course Description  

This course covers fundamental digital logic design concepts and their implementation on FPGA hardware. Topics include combinational and sequential circuit design, state machines, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and interfacing with external peripherals. The course involves hands-on experience with simulation tools and FPGA programming.
